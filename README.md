# DickensCats
This repository was created to visualize references to cats within the novels of Charles Dickens, in honor of International Cat Day 2018 and Charles Dickens’s cat “Bob.” 

For more on "Bob," see Jenny Pyke's article "Charles Dickens and the Caw Pat Letter Opener" (https://www.19.bbk.ac.uk/articles/10.16995/ntn.701/).

Please note that the corpus used in this data visualization was originally compiled by the University of Birmingham Centre for Corpus Research (https://github.com/birmingham-ccr).

Please note as well that the scripts used for this visualization are based on my ever evolving Recreational Reckoning methodology (see https://github.com/AnoffCobblah/RR-Recreational-Reckoning-Main).
